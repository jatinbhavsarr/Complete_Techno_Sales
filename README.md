# Complete_Techno_Sales: Sales Performance Dashboard (2020â€“2022)

## Executive Summary
The **Complete_Techno_Sales** project involves creating a dynamic **Power BI dashboard** to analyze and visualize sales data for the years **2020 to 2022**. The dashboard integrates information from **sales performance**, **supervisors' data**, **regional insights** (state-level analysis), and **brand performance** to offer actionable insights that enhance sales strategies, improve regional operations, and optimize brand management.

## Business Problem
**Complete_Techno** faced challenges in tracking and analyzing sales performance effectively across different regions and brands. The company lacked visibility into how sales varied by **supervisor**, **state**, and **brand**, making it difficult to identify areas for improvement and tailor strategies to increase sales. The absence of a comprehensive sales performance dashboard led to missed opportunities in decision-making.

## Objective
The primary objective of this project was to create an interactive **Power BI dashboard** that:
- Analyzes sales data by **state**, **supervisor performance**, and **brand** for the years **2020 to 2022**.
- Identifies key sales trends, **high-performing regions**, and the **top-selling products** by brand.
- Provides insights for optimizing sales strategies and improving regional sales management.
- Enhances performance tracking for **supervisors** to recognize top performers and identify areas for development.
- Improves decision-making by delivering actionable insights from historical sales data.

## Tools I Use
- **Power BI**: For creating interactive visualizations and performance dashboards.
- **DAX**: For performing complex data calculations and generating key performance metrics.
- **Power Query**: For transforming and cleaning sales data and integrating multiple data sources.

## Suggestions
- Offer exclusive deals or bundles for these brands to boost customer loyalty and sales further.
- To counter the declining average quantity sold per transaction, introduce **upselling** and **cross-selling** strategies.
- Capitalize on the peak sales months of **March, April, and May** by launching seasonal promotions or discounts during these periods.
- Recognize and reward top-performing supervisors like **Aarvi Gupta** and **Ajay Sharma** for their contributions to sales.
- Develop **loyalty programs** and **personalized offers** for high-value customers to encourage repeat business.
- Share best practices from high-performing supervisors with others through **training** or **mentorship programs**.
- Launch **mid-year flash sales** and offer incentives to stimulate orders during slower periods.

## Challenges
A major challenge was ensuring accurate **data integration** across different regions, supervisors, and brands. Managing and transforming large sales datasets from multiple sources was time-consuming, and ensuring data consistency across the various levels of analysis required robust data cleaning and transformation using **Power Query**. Furthermore, building a dashboard that could provide real-time insights without compromising on performance, especially with such large datasets, was a significant technical challenge.

## Learnings
- Gained expertise in using **DAX** for complex sales analysis, including time-based comparisons and performance metrics by **state** and **supervisor**.
- Enhanced skills in **Power Query** for cleaning and transforming large datasets, ensuring consistency across different regions and brands.
- Learned to create **data-driven dashboards** that provide quick insights into sales performance, helping guide business strategies.
- Developed the ability to identify **sales trends** and **performance gaps** across different dimensions, such as **state**, **supervisor**, and **brand**.
- Gained experience in optimizing **Power BI dashboards** for large datasets, maintaining performance and speed while delivering actionable insights.
